# RedScript  
### A Ruby flavored superset of JavaScript

RedScript was created to provide a better syntax for AMD modules and to provide
a few aliases to make things a bit nicer to work with.

It was also created as a side project to learn more about Node, NPM Modules and
to learn Regular Expressions. In the future I would also like to add a
lexer/parser to implement more advanced features (feel free to fork!).

I would also like to let JavaScript's prototype goodness shine through by adding
conviences and syntax to make working with straight objects and prototypes
*easier* than using faux classes and constructors.
